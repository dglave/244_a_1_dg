```{r}

food_graphable <- select_foods %>% 
drop_na(energy_kcal, ends_with( "_g"))
  

### Then, we make an autoplot of the above PCA, to visualize how Fat and micro nutrients relate to one another. 

autoplot(three_food_pca, 
         data = food_graphable,
         colour = "food_group",
         loadings = TRUE,
         loadings.label = TRUE,
         size = 0.4) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs( color = "Food Groups") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Some observations on the Biplot:
 - Principal components 1 and 2 cover 76.2% of all variance
- Protein (in grams) is straight up, meaning that is positively correlates with PC2.
 - None of the variables point to the right. This means that none of these variables are positively. 
 - Variables, shown in red lines, that are close in angle, are very correlated.
 - The same goes for points! Points that appear in clusters are closely related across the first principal components. In this plot, the *Poultry* and *Vegetables* food groups form clusters, while very few of the *Snack* points cluster together.
